# Implementation specification changelog

## Import-free adapter artifact profile — 2026-09-23

- Fresh ProcessDeployment histories default to `scoped-anchored-v5`, which requires signed effect resource policy `/3` and import-free adapter artifact `/2` for effectful modules. Deployment `/5`, prepared `/3`, effect plan `/3` and anchored host config `/3` bind the new authority profile. The trusted signer anchor remains external to the reloadable factory.
- The V2 adapter artifact signs exact source bytes and the `aether.adapter-js-import-free/1` rule. A pinned ES module parser rejects static/dynamic imports, re-exports from dependencies, `import.meta` and unsupported syntax before evaluating approved bytes. Existing V1 artifact and policy bytes remain available only through explicit legacy admission/profile choices.
- An adversarial review reproduced a signed-policy router-subclass bypass. Signed V2/V3 ProcessHost effects now call nonvirtual broker bind/mode/identity/invoke methods with JavaScript-private state, preventing that router override from dispatching an unapproved sink after identity validation.
- This closes ordinary module dependency resolution for the new trusted-JS profile. It does not confine ambient Node globals or malicious code. OS/guest isolation, external epoch rollback resistance, signer rotation and complete all-path containment remain open. Specification 0.1.0, acceptance gates and release thresholds are unchanged.

## Independently anchored effect-policy signer — 2026-09-23

- Fresh ProcessDeployment histories default to `scoped-anchored-v4`. A trusted operator/admission caller supplies an Ed25519 public key, signer/repository identity and stable epoch-authority identity outside the reloadable services factory. Factory-provided key and epoch callbacks are refused.
- Deployment `/4`, prepared `/2`, effect-plan `/2` and host-config `/2` bind the anchor digest. Signed policy v2 is checked against the anchor at admission, reopen, promotion and live effect boundaries. A direct signed ProcessHost without an anchor now requires an explicit legacy signer-trust selection.
- Old deployment and host formats remain byte-preserved under explicit historical profiles. In-place signer rotation or implicit adoption of an old unanchored history is not inferred; an authenticated new-deployment migration is required until a versioned rotation protocol exists.
- This closes the reproduced signer-key substitution path under the stated external trust boundary. The operator epoch source must itself prevent rollback. The V4-T2-04 acceptance gates and specification version 0.1.0 are unchanged; full all-path containment and adapter isolation remain open.

## Capability deployment profile implementation — 2026-09-22

- ProcessDeployment now persists capability authority as `aether.process-deployment/3`. Fresh effectful deployments default to signed resource/adapter-artifact policy v2 with scoped grants; signed descriptor-only v3, unsigned scoped-v2 and legacy sealed authority require explicit profiles.
- The default artifact profile now also requires `aether.evidence-policy/2`: process-isolated v4 SMT checking is part of the approved execution manifest. V1 evidence/checker behavior remains available in explicit compatibility profiles.
- Existing v1/v2 records require an explicit adoption choice. The active factory and existing host configuration are checked before the record is rewritten, retaining old bytes on mismatch or crash.
- This implements the existing V4-T2-04 containment contract; acceptance gates and specification version 0.1.0 are unchanged. Signed adapter code admission and complete path coverage remain open.

## Target-profile decision — 2026-09-22

- The user selected fresh guest startup on an already-running hypervisor and guest resident memory for the unchanged 1 ms / 2 MB limits.
- Added `decisions/D07-native-qualification-profile.json` version 1.0.0. Historical measurements remain intact; controller startup and RSS are diagnostics. The current guest-startup maximum still misses 1 ms.
- This fills a previously open target-profile parameter; functional contracts and specification version 0.1.0 remain unchanged.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-22

- Established the implementation specification against code commit `3c3c8ebe63078f104f1ab7d8182b088124e9b1c6` and the preserved v4.0 PRD.
- Defined state preservation, canonical identities, effect/replay behavior, candidate replication, proof validation, promotion recovery and benchmark evidence contracts.
- Added a separate v4 dependency tracker covering all 40 functional requirements, 16 NFR obligations, three governance obligations and 12 KPI statements.
- Prioritized the state-loss repair and real-tokenizer benchmark correction in an eight-task first slice.
- Recorded four research gates for replication/quorum, native targets, certificates/ZK and numerical/learning interfaces.
- Kept runtime implementation tasks planned; existing v1 completion records are unchanged.
